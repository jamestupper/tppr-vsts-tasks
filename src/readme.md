# James Tupper's VSTS/TFS Build Tasks

![Build status](https://tupper.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/e6ee16d3-eb0e-4d58-9b05-ec59019b1b2a/24/badge)

Tasks here are built because there isn't already a task in the [Marketplace](http://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) that does it.

## Current tasks

1. **Run Concordion Tests**

    This task will run Concordion tests using NUnit console. Currently, addins do not work with the NUnit test adapters ([see Github issue here](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/222)).
